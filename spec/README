Sapphire Test Suite

How to set up tests:
  All files place in this directory with an extension of .sp will be ran as sapphire tests.

  All other extensions will be ignored.

  To create a test, simply fill a .sp file with valid (or tobe valid) syntax.
  For example:
    if some_instance_var == 5
      puts "var is equal to 5"
    end
